## Merging PDF in seconds without quality loss in Python
### The project consists of solving the problem of merging PDF's without loss of quality in a blasting fast speed

The project is implemented in Python and uses a web-server hosted on Flask to let the user enter the PDF's location and get the output directly saved on the local machine.  
  
The project uses PyPdf's merger object to merge PDF's  and the local machine's power to merge the PDF's.  
So, No Uploading Required.
